## Understanding Root Canal Therapy

Root canal therapy, also known as endodontic treatment, is a procedure designed to treat the innermost part of a tooth, called the pulp. When the pulp becomes infected or inflamed due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures, cracks, or trauma, it can cause severe toothache, sensitivity, and even lead to abscess formation.

Root canal therapy involves the following steps:

- **Evaluation and Diagnosis** - Our skilled dentist will examine your tooth, review your dental history, and may request X-rays to assess the extent of the infection or damage. Based on the evaluation, we will determine if root canal therapy is the appropriate treatment for your specific situation.

- **Anesthesia** - Before starting the procedure, we will administer local anesthesia to ensure your comfort throughout the process. If desired, additional sedation options can be discussed to help you feel more relaxed during the procedure.

- **Access and Cleaning** - An access hole is created in the tooth to reach the infected or inflamed pulp. The damaged pulp, along with any bacteria or debris, is carefully removed from the root canals. The canals are then thoroughly cleaned and shaped to facilitate the filling process.

- **Filling and Sealing** - Once the canals are cleaned and shaped, they are filled with a biocompatible material called gutta-percha. This material seals the canals to prevent reinfection and restores the tooth's structure.

- **Restoration** - After the root canal therapy, a dental crown or filling is placed over the treated tooth to protect it and restore its function and appearance.

## Benefits of Root Canal Therapy

Root canal therapy offers several benefits, including:

- **Pain Relief** - Root canal therapy effectively relieves toothache and sensitivity caused by infected or inflamed pulp, providing significant pain relief.

- **Preservation of Natural Tooth** - By treating the infected tooth instead of extracting it, root canal therapy allows you to keep your natural tooth, maintaining proper biting and chewing function.

- **Prevention of Further Infections** - By removing the infected pulp and sealing the root canals, root canal therapy prevents the spread of infection to surrounding teeth and helps avoid complications such as abscess formation.

- **Restored Aesthetics** - Following root canal therapy, a dental crown or filling is placed, restoring the tooth's appearance and ensuring a natural-looking smile.
