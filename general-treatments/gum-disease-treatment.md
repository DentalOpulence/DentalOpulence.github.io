# Gum Disease Treatment

At Dental Opulence, we understand the importance of healthy gums for maintaining optimal oral health. Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is a common condition that affects the gums and supporting structures of the teeth. If left untreated, it can lead to gum recession, tooth loss, and even impact your overall health. Our experienced dental team offers comprehensive gum disease treatment to restore the health and vitality of your gums.

## Understanding Gum Disease

Gum disease is typically caused by the buildup of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that forms on the teeth and gums. When plaque is not removed through regular brushing and flossing, it hardens into tartar, which can irritate and inflame the gums.

This initial stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis and is characterized by symptoms such as:

- Red, swollen, or tender gums
- Bleeding gums, especially during brushing or flossing
- Persistent bad breath
- Gum recession or teeth appearing longer
- Changes in the bite or teeth alignment

If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to a more advanced stage called periodontitis, where the infection spreads below the gumline, leading to bone loss and potential tooth loss.

## Our Gum Disease Treatment Approach

At Dental Opulence, we take a proactive approach to gum disease treatment. Our skilled dental team will thoroughly evaluate the health of your gums, teeth, and supporting structures to determine the severity of the condition. We will then develop a customized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.

Our gum disease treatment options may include:

- **Scaling and Root Planing** - This non-surgical procedure involves the removal of plaque and tartar from above and below the gumline (scaling) and smoothing the tooth roots (root planing) to eliminate bacterial buildup and promote healing.

- **Antibiotic Therapy** - In some cases, antibiotics may be prescribed to help control bacterial infection and promote gum healing.

- **Periodontal Maintenance** - Following gum disease treatment, we will develop a personalized maintenance plan to help you manage and prevent the recurrence of gum disease. This may involve regular professional cleanings, more frequent check-ups, and personalized oral hygiene instructions.

- **Advanced Periodontal Treatment** - In severe cases of gum disease, we may recommend advanced periodontal treatments, such as gum grafting, bone grafting, or guided tissue regeneration, to restore gum health and support the teeth.

## Preventing Gum Disease

Prevention is key to maintaining healthy gums. To reduce your risk of gum disease, we recommend the following preventive measures:

- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene** - Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily to remove plaque and prevent its buildup.

- **Regular Dental Visits** - Visit our office for routine check-ups and professional cleanings. Regular dental examinations allow us to detect gum disease in its early stages and provide timely treatment.

- **Healthy Lifestyle Choices** - Avoid tobacco use, as it increases the risk of gum disease and compromises oral health. Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limit sugary and acidic foods and beverages.
