# White Fillings

At our dental practice, we understand that tooth decay can be a concern for many patients. That's why we offer white fillings as a cosmetic and functional solution for cavities. White fillings are a tooth-colored alternative to traditional metal (silver amalgam) fillings and can be used to restore decayed or damaged teeth, as well as replace old metal fillings for a more natural and pleasing appearance.

During your visit, our dentist will first remove the decay from the affected tooth, and then place the white filling material. This material is made of a composite resin that can be matched to the color of your natural teeth, making the filling virtually invisible. White fillings are not only more aesthetically pleasing but also bond directly to the tooth surface, providing a strong and durable restoration.

In addition to improving the appearance of your teeth, white fillings can also help to preserve the natural structure of your tooth, providing a long-lasting solution for your oral health. Our patients who have replaced their old metal fillings with white fillings have reported significant improvement in the appearance of their smile and an increase in self-confidence. We believe in providing our patients with the best options for their dental needs and white fillings are an excellent choice for those who want to maintain both their oral health and their beautiful smile. Contact us today to schedule your appointment and learn more about how white fillings can benefit you.
