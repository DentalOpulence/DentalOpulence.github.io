# Bridges

At our dental practice, we understand that missing teeth can affect not only your oral health but also your self-confidence. That's why we offer dental bridges as a solution for replacing missing teeth.

A dental bridge is a custom-made prosthetic device that bridges the gap between one or more missing teeth. It is typically made up of two or more crowns (or caps) for the teeth on either side of the gap and a false tooth (or pontic) in between. The crowns are placed over the natural teeth adjacent to the gap, and the pontic is suspended in the gap, effectively "bridging" the gap and restoring the natural appearance of your smile.

Our skilled dentists will work with you to determine the best solution for your individual needs and create a treatment plan that will give you the smile you deserve. Dental bridges are made of high-quality materials that are designed to look natural and function just like your own teeth. They can be matched to the color of your natural teeth, making them virtually invisible.

We understand that missing teeth can affect not only your oral health but also your self-confidence and quality of life, which is why we make it a priority to replace missing teeth with a dental bridge or other options. Contact us today to schedule your appointment and learn more about how a dental bridge can benefit you and give you the smile you've always wanted.
