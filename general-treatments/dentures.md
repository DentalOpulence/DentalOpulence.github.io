# Dentures

At our dental practice, we understand that missing teeth can affect not only your oral health but also your self-confidence. That's why we offer partial and complete dentures as solutions for replacing missing teeth.

Partial dentures are a removable prosthetic device that replaces one or more missing teeth, and are typically used when some natural teeth remain in the upper or lower jaw. They are made of a plastic base that supports replacement teeth, and are held in place by clasps or precision attachments that connect to the remaining natural teeth.

Complete dentures, on the other hand, are used when all of the natural teeth are missing in an arch. These are also removable and are made of acrylic resin base that fits over the gums, supporting a full set of replacement teeth.

Our skilled dentists will work with you to determine the best solution for your individual needs and create a treatment plan that will give you the smile you deserve. Dentures are made of high-quality materials that are designed to look natural and function just like your own teeth. They can be adjusted and relined as needed to ensure a comfortable fit and optimal function.

We understand that missing teeth can affect not only your oral health but also your self-confidence and quality of life, which is why we make it a priority to replace missing teeth with partial or complete dentures or other options. Contact us today to schedule your appointment and learn more about how partial and complete dentures can benefit you and give you the smile you've always wanted.
