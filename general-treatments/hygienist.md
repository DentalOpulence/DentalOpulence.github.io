# Hygienist

A visit with one of our highly trained dental hygienists is an essential part of maintaining a healthy and beautiful smile. Our hygienists are dedicated to providing personalised and gentle care to ensure that your teeth and gums are clean and healthy. During your visit, the hygienist will thoroughly clean your teeth, remove any plaque or tartar, and polish your teeth to a sparkling shine.

They will also check for any signs of gum disease and provide preventative care to help you avoid future dental problems. At the end of your visit, you will leave with a fresh, clean mouth and a better understanding of how to maintain optimal oral health. We believe that preventative care and education are key to maintaining a healthy smile and we will work with you to develop an individualized care plan.
