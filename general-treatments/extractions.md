# Extractions

At our dental practice, we understand that the thought of a tooth extraction can be stressful for some patients. That's why we strive to make the extraction process as comfortable and anxiety-free as possible.

A tooth extraction is the removal of a tooth from its socket in the jaw bone. Extractions are typically recommended when a tooth is severely decayed, infected, or damaged beyond repair. Our skilled dentists will first numb the area around the tooth to minimize any discomfort during the procedure, and use the latest techniques and equipment to ensure the extraction is as smooth as possible.

After the tooth has been removed, our dentist will provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for the extraction site and manage any discomfort to ensure a speedy recovery. We'll also discuss options for tooth replacement, such as dental implants or bridges, to help you regain full function and a beautiful smile.

We understand that the thought of a tooth extraction can be stressful, which is why we make it a priority to provide our patients with the highest level of care and comfort during the procedure. Our team of experienced professionals will work with you every step of the way to ensure that you have a positive experience. Contact us today to schedule your appointment and learn more about how we can make your tooth extraction as comfortable as possible.
