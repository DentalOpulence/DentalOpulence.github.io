# Fixed Retainers

At our dental practice, we understand that maintaining a straight and aligned smile after completing orthodontic treatment is essential to ensure longevity of the results. That's why we offer fixed retainers as a convenient and comfortable solution for maintaining your beautiful new smile, in conjunction with removable retainers.

Fixed retainers are a type of orthodontic appliance that are designed to hold your teeth in their new position after orthodontic treatment, such as braces or Invisalign. They are custom-made to fit your teeth perfectly and bond a thin wire to the back of your upper or lower teeth, which holds them in place. They are virtually invisible and can be used to retain upper or lower teeth.

While fixed retainers are an effective way to keep your teeth in place, it's important to remember that they are not a replacement for removable retainers. Removable retainers should still be worn as directed by your orthodontist to ensure that your teeth stay in their new position long term.

Our team of experienced professionals will work with you to determine the best solution for your individual needs, provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for both fixed and removable retainers and recommend a treatment plan that will give you the best results, ensuring the longevity of your beautiful new smile. Contact us today to schedule your consultation and learn more about how fixed retainers can benefit you and preserve your beautiful new smile in conjunction with removable retainers.
