Vivera retainers are made from a durable and long-lasting material that is designed to hold your teeth in their new position after orthodontic treatment, such as braces or Invisalign. These retainers are custom-made to fit your teeth perfectly, ensuring maximum comfort and effectiveness. They are also virtually invisible and removable, allowing you to take them out while eating, brushing, or flossing.

Our team of experienced professionals will work with you to determine the best solution for your individual needs, provide you with detailed instructions on how to use the retainers and recommend a treatment plan that will give you the best results. Vivera retainers are a safe, effective and comfortable way to maintain your beautiful new smile after orthodontic treatment.

We believe that maintaining a straight and aligned smile after orthodontic treatment is important to ensure longevity of the results and boost self-confidence and improve overall well-being. That's why we make it a priority to provide our patients with the best options for maintaining their new smile, such as Vivera retainers. Contact us today to schedule your consultation and learn more about how Vivera retainers can benefit you and preserve your beautiful new smile.
