# Internal Tooth Whitening

At our dental practice, we understand that discoloured or stained teeth can affect your self-confidence and overall well-being. That's why we offer internal tooth whitening as a solution for achieving a brighter, more youthful-looking smile.

Internal tooth whitening, also known as endodontic bleaching, is a procedure that is used to whiten teeth that have become discoloured or stained from within. The procedure involves applying a bleaching agent, typically whitening gel, to the inside of the tooth through a small opening made by the dentist. The bleaching agent then removes the discoloration, stains and darkness of the tooth, working form the inside out.

Internal tooth whitening is a safe and effective way to whiten teeth that have become discoloured due to injury, infection, or other internal factors. Our team of experienced professionals will work with you to determine the best solution for your individual needs and recommend a treatment plan that will give you the best results.

We believe that a beautiful smile can boost self-confidence and improve overall well-being, which is why we make it a priority to provide our patients with options for teeth whitening, including internal tooth whitening for those who have discoloration or stains that are not responsive to external whitening methods. Contact us today to schedule your consultation and learn more about how internal tooth whitening can benefit you and give you the smile you've always wanted.
