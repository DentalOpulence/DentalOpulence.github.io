Composite edge bonding is a non-invasive procedure that involves applying a tooth-colored composite resin material to the edges of your teeth. This material is sculpted and shaped to match the contour of your existing teeth, and is then hardened and polished to create a natural-looking finish. The result is an improvement in the appearance of your teeth, that can be used to fix minor imperfections such as chips, cracks, or gaps.

Our skilled dentists will work with you to determine the best solution for your individual needs and create a treatment plan that will give you the smile you deserve. Composite edge bonding is a cost-effective and non-invasive way to improve the appearance of your teeth, and it can be completed in just one visit.

We believe that a beautiful smile can boost self-confidence and improve overall well-being, which is why we make it a priority to not only maintain oral health but also enhance the appearance of your teeth. Contact us today to schedule your appointment and learn more about how composite edge bonding can benefit you and give you the smile you've always wanted.
